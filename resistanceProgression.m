%This script compiles 384-well PI viability data collected over time into
%plots of which wells have gained resistance to the drug they are treated
%with.  

%Input is the location of a folder containing one csv file for each
%timepoint named as the date in the YYYYMMDD format. In each file there is
%five columns of PI-%'s starting on row 4, One for every well, then one
%each for each of the four drugs used on the 384 well plate FACS'd. (One
%384 well plate is the combination of four 96 well plates). Column 1 is the
%well number, column 2 is the well type which is the drug name in this
%case, column 3 is PI value for all wells, columns 4-7 are PI values for
%each drug with NaN's for wells that don't contain that drug.

%Outputs are: 4 csv's (one per drug) with the following data: 96-well
%plate ID's, PI value of each well over each week and average killing each week.
%Another similar csv with ranks instead of PI value, where lowest rank is
%highest PI value, this correlates to degree of resistance. Another csv
%with z-scores instead of ranks. Plots of rank and z-score vs. week with
%cell lines with rank below 50 for X weeks highlighted. You can also input
%the dose of each drug at each week and this will be added to the plot.
